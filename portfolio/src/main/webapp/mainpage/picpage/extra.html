		<p>The frozen stare of the sheep exudes palpable fear. As I walked in the Irish countryside, flocks of sheep
			would run
			to the gates in frenzy, greeting myself and any passerby. However, this sheep seemed to shy away from the
			camera,
			posing for a brief second before dissapearing in the nearby hedges. The yellow flowers add a speckle of
			colour and
			brightness to the otherwise drab and overcast scene.</p>

		<p> Depsite the tumultous protests below, the mountain parks in Hong Kong retain a quiet air of peace. This
